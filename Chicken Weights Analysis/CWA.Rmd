# Descriptive Statistics


```{r chickwts, echo=FALSE}
chickwts %>% 
  group_by(feed)%>%
  summarise(n = length(feed),
            avg = mean(weight),
            SD = sd(weight))

```

# Plots


```{r chickwts1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(chickwts, aes(feed, weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
```{r chickwts2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(chickwts, aes(feed, weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 1) + stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, fun.args = list(mult = 1), col = "red")

```

# Inferential Statistics
The one-way ANOVA summary:
```{r chickwts3, echo=FALSE}
chickwts_lm <- lm(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
anova(chickwts_lm) 
```
# Tukeyâ€™s Post-hoc test:
```{r chickwts4, echo=FALSE}
chickwts_lm <- lm(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
chickwts.av <- aov(chickwts_lm)
tukey.test <- TukeyHSD(chickwts.av)
tukey.test
```
